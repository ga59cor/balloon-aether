This is an example of an input file for both, SiGOGprec and SiGOGbcst software.
The input file must be named input.txt and must contain the following data in 
the specified format and in the specified order. SiGOG will simulate as many 
receivers as sequentially written in this input file. Please note SiGOG reads data
looking for a double star at beginning of the record. 

Information and format that input file must have:
- Station monument coordinates in km. Format: (2X,3(F14.7,1X))
- Station name and observations we want to generate. Format:(2X,A4,1X,5A2)
- Elevation mask (degrees) AND generation of tropospheric error (S/N). Format:(2X,F4.1,1X,A1)
- Date and initial epoch. Format:(2X,I4,4(1X,I2),1X,F11.8)
- Final epoch. Format: (2X,2(I2,1X),F11.8) 
- Time interval between observations. Format: (2X,F8.2)
- Date of creation of RINEX observation file. Format: (2X,A20)
- H/E/N offsets from the monument to the antenna reference point. Format: (8X, 3F8.4)

The SiGOG program will read until end of input file to see if there is any
other simulation to do.
