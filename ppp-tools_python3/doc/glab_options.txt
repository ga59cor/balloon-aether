                            information in the selection of measurements to be used in the filter

                                                    specified by the '-input:snx' parameter
                            <val> = calculate       The receiver a priori position will be calculated by the program.
                                                    This is specially useful when processing moving receivers (trajectories)
                                                    or when the approximate receiver position is not known. With this option
                                                    activated, the differential fields of the OUTPUT message will be zero.

                                                    file (provided by '-input:rec') [default if '-input:rec' provided]
                            <val> = 0               Set the receiver type as 'Unknown' [default]
                            <val> = 1               Set the receiver type as 'Cross-correlated'
                                                    In this mode, P2 will be corrected with the DCB of P1-C1
                            <val> = 2               Set the receiver type as 'No P1'
                                                    In this mode, C1 will be used instead of P1
                            <val> = 3               Set the receiver type as 'Consistent measurements'
    -pre:prealign           Prealign carrier phase measurements with its corresponding pseudorange [default on]
    -pre:cs:li              Use the carrier phase geometric-free combination (Li) for cycle-slip detection (2 frequencies) [default in PPP]
    --pre:cs:li             Do not use carrier phase geometric-free combination (Li) for cycle-slip detection (2 frequencies) [default in SPP]
                            Li combination is a slow varying function which only has ambiguity and ionosphere
                            Each epoch and satellite an expected Li value is computed and compared against the
                            measured one, if this difference is above a certain threshold, a cycle-slip is marked.
                            This threshold is (max + (min-max)*exp(-dt/t)), being dt the time between epochs
    -pre:cs:li:min <val>    Minimum threshold between estimated and measured Li values [default 0.034]
    -pre:cs:li:max <val>    Maximum threshold between estimated and measured Li values [default 0.08]
    -pre:cs:li:t0 <val>     Time constant to set the threshold between maximum and minimum [default 60]
    -pre:cs:bw              Use Melbourne-Wübbena (BW) for cycle-slip detection (2 frequencies) [default in PPP]
    --pre:cs:bw             Do not use Melbourne-Wübbena (BW) for cycle-slip detection (2 frequencies) [default in SPP]
                            BW combination is a mixed combination between carrier phase and pseudoranges.
                            This combination is free of ionosphere and geometry, thence constant, but
                            has a high noise (due to the pseudorange measurements used). If this noise is
                            low enough, it is straightforward to detect cycle-slips, but in noisy environments
                            BW is not able to detect cycle-slips. The algorithm using BW computes the mean and
                            the standard deviation of the last epochs in order to obtain an estimated value
                            and the noise level of the combination. The estimated value is compared against the
                            measured value, and the noise level is used for the threshold of this difference.
                            Difference must be lower than standard deviation multiplied by a number (slope).
                            This threshold has minimum (min) and maximum (max) saturation values.
    -pre:cs:min <val>       Minimum threshold between estimated and measured BW values in relation to its standard deviation [default 0.9]
    -pre:cs:max <val>       Maximum threshold between estimated and measured BW values in relation to its standard deviation [default 18]
    -pre:cs:slope <val>     Relation between estimated and measured BW values in relation to its standard deviation [default 9]
    -pre:cs:l1c1            Use the L1-C1 combination for cycle-slip detection (1 frequency) [default in PPP]
    --pre:cs:l1c1           Do not use the L1-C1 combination for cycle-slip detection (1 frequency) [default in SPP]
                            The L1-C1 averages the difference between carrier phase and pseudorange measurements in F1 for several epochs.
                            This cycle-slip detection method is very useful for single-frequency receivers, as it only requires
                            measurements from one frequency. As a counterpart, the ionospheric term is different for C1 and L1
                            thence, this combination will tend to diverge. It becomes necessary to set a smoothing window
                            to limit this divergence (-pre:cs:l1c1:window). This makes that this method becomes a bit limited
                            with data rates too low. Ideally this method should be used with rates of 1Hz
    -pre:cs:l1c1:slope <val>       Relation between estimated and measured L1-C1 values in relation to its standard deviation [default 5]
    -pre:cs:l1c1:window <val>      Number of epochs to limit the L1-C1 ionosphere divergence [default 100]
    -pre:cs:l1c1:max <val>         Maximum standard deviation for the threshold calculation in the L1-C1 [default 15] (m) 
    -pre:cs:l1c1:init <val>        Initial standard deviation for the threshold calculation in the L1-C1 [default 1] (m)

    -filter:fixedweight <n> <val>         Apply the specified standard deviation to the measurement 'n', to be used as weight in the filter.

                            <val>  = Standard deviation of the measurement (m)
                            In particular, the filter shall apply as weight = 1/(<val>^2)
                            Sample: '-filter:fixedweight 1 2'    Set 2 meters of standard deviation to measurement 1 in filter

    -filter:elevweight <n> <a> <b> <c>    Apply the specified values to compute the standard deviation of the measurement 'n'

                            Again, the filter shall apply as weight = 1/(std^2)
                            Sample: '-filter:elevweight 1 0.3 8 10'   Apply the standard deviation: 0.3+8*e^(-elevation/10)
                            Note: '-filter:elevweight 1 x 0 y' equals to '-filter:fixedweight 1 x'

    -filter:backward        Specify that the filter does a backward processing after the forward one is finished. This meas that it
                            process the data backwards. The "turn point" is defined as the latest point where orbits and clocks
                            are available or when the observation RINEX ends (whatever is first) ('--filter:backward' to disable it)
                            [default disabled]

  WORK MODES
    gLAB can work in four different modes:
        - Positioning Mode: 'Standard' mode, where all the processing is done, and a solution for a
                       receiver is provided as OUTPUT messages. The minimum parameters required for this
                       mode are an input observation file ('-input:obs') and orbit and clock products
                       ('-input:nav', '-input:SP3' or '-input:orb'/'-input:clk'). Using precise products
                       will also require the use of an ANTEX file ('-input:ant')
        - Show Input Mode: This mode only reads an input RINEX observation file and print its measurements.
                       The parameter required for this mode is '-input:obs', and specifically, no orbit and
                       clock products should be provided (if provided, gLAB will switch to Positioning Mode)
        - Product Comparison Mode: This mode reads and compares two different sources of orbit and clock products.
                       In order to use this mode, '-input:obs' must be avoided, and two different orbit and clock
                       products should be provided. This mode outputs the SATDIFF, SATSTAT and STASTATTOT messages
        - Show Product Mode: This mode reads a single source of orbit and clock products.
                       In order to use this mode, '-input:obs' must be avoided, and a single orbit and clock
                       product should be provided. This mode output SAT messages
