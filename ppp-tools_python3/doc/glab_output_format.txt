    FILTER
        Filter solution message. This message provides direct information on the filter estimates. It is shown
        in each filter execution.
        Field 1:  'FILTER'
        Field 2:  Year
        Field 3:  Doy
        Field 4:  Seconds of day
        Field 5-: Filter estimates. The order is: 3D estimated position, clock, troposphere and ambiguities
        The number of fields is variable in this message. With a full filter (troposphere and ambiguities
        estimation), the fields are as follows:
            Field 5:  Receiver X position [m]
            Field 6:  Receiver Y position [m]
            Field 7:  Receiver Z position [m]
            Field 8:  Receiver clock [m]
            Field 9:  Zenith Tropospheric Delay [m]
            Field 10: Carrierphase ambiguities [m]
